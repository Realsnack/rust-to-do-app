# To-Do List Application Requirements (Generated by ChatGPT)

## 1. Application Overview

The application will be a command-line-based To-Do List tool that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. The tasks should be stored in a file for persistence.

## 2. Task Structure

Each task should have the following attributes:

- Unique ID
- Title (required)
- Description (optional)
- Due date (optional)
- Status (Not started, In progress, Completed)

## 3. Commands

The application should support the following commands with their respective functionality:

- `add` – Add a new task to the list. The user should be able to provide the task title, description, and due date. The application should generate a unique ID for each task and set its initial status to 'Not started'.
- `list` – Display all tasks in the list. Optionally, allow users to filter tasks by status or due date.
- `update` – Update an existing task's title, description, due date, or status. The user should provide the unique ID of the task to update.
- `delete` – Delete a task from the list. The user should provide the unique ID of the task to delete.
- `help` – Show a help message with usage instructions and a list of available commands.

## 4. User Input Validation

The application should validate user input and provide helpful error messages when the input is incorrect.

## 5. Data Persistence

The application should store the task list in a file (e.g., JSON, CSV, or plain text). It should load the data from the file when the application starts and save any changes back to the file when the application exits or after each command execution.

## 6. Error Handling

The application should handle errors gracefully, such as file I/O errors or invalid command usage, and display appropriate error messages to the user.

## 7. User Experience

The application should provide a clear and intuitive command-line interface, with helpful prompts and messages to guide the user.
